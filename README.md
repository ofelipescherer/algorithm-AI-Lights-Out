# Lights Out :bulb:
[Lights Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) is a puzzle from which you need to turn off all the lights, which can be arranged as a rectangular matrix. Each time you click on a matrix tile, it changes the state between on and off. This logic also applies to adjacent tiles. The object of the game is to turn off all the lights.

# About :blue_book:
In this repository you will find an artificial inteligence to solve the Lights Out Puzzle.
We use matrices 3x3 and 4x4 because greater than this will cost a lot of processing. The program was made in Java language and the concept of [State Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space) was used.
